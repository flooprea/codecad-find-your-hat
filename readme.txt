Open source project from codecademy.com

The purpose of this project is to make use of Node.js modules and nmp to create an interactive game that can be ran in the terminal.

Game description:
The user is prompted with a field as per below. The "*" represents the player's character, the "░" represents the field and the "o" represents the holes if which the player could fall while looking for the hat "^".

The player indicates the directions that they want to move the character  by inputing the letters l, r, u, d. 

The player loses if they go out of bounds or fall in a hole, and wins when they find the hat.
      
        *,░,░,░,░,░
        ░,░,░,░,░,░,░
        ░,░,░,░,░,░,░
        ^,O,░,░,░,░,░
        ░,░,░,░,░,░,░
        ░,░,O,░,░,O,░
        ░,O,░,░,░,░,░

Optional stuff:
-Have the character start on a random location that’s not the upper-left corner.
-Create a “hard mode” where one or more holes are added after certain turns.
-Improve your game’s graphics and interactivity in the terminal. There are many helpful packages to assist with this, and you can really get creative with how you approach terminal games.https://github.com/cronvel/terminal-kit/blob/master/README.md
-Create a field validator to ensure that the field generated by Field.generateField() can actually be solved. This might be pretty difficult! You’ll essentially be creating a version of a maze solver.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maze_solving_algorithm
